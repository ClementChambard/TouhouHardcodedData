# Touhou hardcoded data

Here you can find json files for reverse engineered data of touhou games.
I use these files in my <a href='https://github.com/ClementChambard/TouhouInterpreter'>touhou interpreter<\a>.

It could be interesting to add support for game patching later, at least for stage and bullet data.
